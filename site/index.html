<h1>The Future Is Yours To Advance the Unknown Future of Technology</h1>
<article style=font-size:50;> The future of computeratical computation and tech hardware/software development brings a lot of guess work and mathamatical equations to program an easier more globally accessible resoure</article>
	<h1>Healthcare Programming in the future improvements</h1>
	<article>Computers and electronic technology in healthcare is advanaced and could improve with the right type of global team work</article>
	<p>healthcare has a lot of software and advanced hardware programs and machines making health care more advanced to take better care and repair health matters is a programmers destiny of future dignity in development in useful technology to improve all that is known to life as a longer healthier more satisfying time spent on this rotating earth in a deep unknown vast galaxy of light and matter developed by a mass force of creation and light we could be programmed in life or we could be the programmers of our own lives</p>
	<h1>Invisible Mechanisms for hardware</h1>
	<article>Software is the invisible program language that operates the mechanics of the hardware behind the scene of the hardware operation</article>
	<p>Software a hidden language in hardware that operates the function of the physical electronic device</p>
	<h1>computer sciences is a art</h1>
	<article>development in computer sciences is relatively new to the global aspects of design and art</article>
	<p>development in all sorts of life skills and practices takes time and concentration to apply to a new piece of art in all types of cultural or learning processes</p>
	<h1>Knowing The Unknown Results</h1>
	<article>guess work in knowing the unknown factors of applying new technologies into a advancing technical degree of an industry with so much intrests</article>
	<p>knowing the unknown is a qoute i really enjoy repeating to myself daily in the morning to know the unknown is a futuristic and already practiced mechanism in todays learning processes and comes with unique understanding of knowing invisibilty in foundations of guess work in mathamatical rational critical thikning</p>

<p onclick alert="('TheComputerGenius')"style="color: yellow; font-size: 20;"> Computers can solve and hold a lot of information really quickly and compute math equations faster than humans even though they are designed and built by human processes Im just starting out my computer program learning, at the age of 30 years old after enrolling in coursera.org a online directory of thousands of university courses. I chose computer programming courses since i have worked alot of general labour jobs here in british columbia canada. I believe i have the know the unknown charecteristics to be able to debug and create unique code one day with a little bit of learning and some hard trained thought of applying unknown routes to the answer of knowing.</p>
<h1 style="color: orange; font-size: 25; text-align: center;">Be very relaxed and breathe with calm cool collective enjoyment on the error logs thats the fun of debugging</h1>

	<h1>Computer Programming is in Enligh Format Who Knew</h1>
	<p>Computer Programming takes a lot of practice and memorizing of different algos and other terms of statements in a language of that of english. I always believed that computer code looked like this ">?#4324NDu9jdwi9k##./#d" A scramble of letters and numbers with symbols with no type of speaking language to it. However after my first JavaScript module I was then corrected by that computer language is in the english language in terms for english coding. It made it alot easier to pursue up until this moment since i know how to spell and see basic hidden concepts in basic math algos. Maybe I can one day get a job or career in a computer chair and sit at a desktop with a coffee mug and type on a keyboard instead of this general labour for minimum wage type effort i have been putting into this earth so far.</p>
