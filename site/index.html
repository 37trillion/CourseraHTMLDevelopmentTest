<h1 style="color: green; font-size: 25; text-align: center;"> Computer languages are made by man, however programming languages can outperform man after initial development </h1>
<p onclick alert="('TheComputerGenius')"style="color: yellow; font-size: 20;"> Computers can solve and hold a lot of information really quickly and compute math equations faster than humans even though they are designed and built by human processes Im just starting out my computer program learning, at the age of 30 years old after enrolling in coursera.org a online directory of thousands of university courses. I chose computer programming courses since i have worked alot of general labour jobs here in british columbia canada. I believe i have the know the unknown charecteristics to be able to debug and create unique code one day with a little bit of learning and some hard trained thought of applying unknown routes to the answer of knowing.</p>
<h2 style="color: orange; font-size: 25; text-align: center;">Be very relaxed and breathe with calm cool collective enjoyment on the error logs thats the fun of debugging</h2>

	<p>Computer Programming takes a lot of practice and memorizing of different algos and other terms of statements in a language of that of english. I always believed that computer code looked like this ">?#4324NDu9jdwi9k##./#d" A scramble of letters and numbers with symbols with no type of speaking language to it. However after my first JavaScript module I was then corrected by that computer language is in the english language in terms for english coding. It made it alot easier to pursue up until this moment since i know how to spell and see basic hidden concepts in basic math algos. Maybe I can one day get a job or career in a computer chair and sit at a desktop with a coffee mug and type on a keyboard instead of this general labour for minimum wage type effort i have been putting into this earth so far.</p>
