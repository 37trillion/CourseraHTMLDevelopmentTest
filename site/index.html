<h1><b>Computer languages are made by man, however programming languages can outperform man after initial development.</b></h1>
<h2><em>Im just starting out my computer program learning, at the age of 30 years old after enrolling in coursera.org a online directory of thousands of university courses. I chose computer programming courses since i have worked alot of general labour jobs here in british columbia canada. I believe i have the know the unknown charecteristics to be able to debug and create unique code one day with a little bit of learning and some hard trained thought of applying unknown routes to the answer of knowing.</em></h2>

<h3>Computer Programming takes a lot of practice and memorizing of different algos and other terms of statements in a language of that of english. I always believed that computer code looked like this ">?#4324NDu9jdwi9k##./#d" A scramble of letters and numbers with symbols with no type of speaking language to it. However after my first JavaScript module I was then corrected by that computer language is in the english language in terms for english coding. It made it alot easier to pursue up until this moment since i know how to spell and see basic hidden concepts in basic math algos. Maybe I can one day get a job or career in a computer chair and sit at a desktop with a coffee mug and type on a keyboard instead of this general labour for minimum wage type effort i have been putting into this earth so far.</h3>
